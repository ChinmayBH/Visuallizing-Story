## The Case of the Missing Camembert

**Characters:**

* **Henrietta "Hen" Dubois:** A sharp-tongued, but kind-hearted cheese monger with a nose for trouble (and even sharper for the perfect ripeness of a Brie).
* **Monsieur Pierre LeFromage:**  A distinguished, albeit slightly pompous, cheesemaker with a secret recipe for the most exquisite Camembert in the region.
* **Marcel "The Mouse" Dupree:**  A notorious cheese thief with a penchant for the finer things in life.  

**Story:**

The air hung heavy with the aroma of ripe Camembert in Hen's tiny shop.  She was arranging a selection of cheeses for her weekly "Taste of France" event when a frantic Monsieur LeFromage burst through the door, his face pale with worry. 

"Henrietta!  Disaster!  A catastrophe!  My prize Camembert!  It's gone!"  He wailed, clutching his top hat as if it were a life preserver.  

Hen, ever the pragmatist, calmed him down with a cup of chamomile tea.  "Hushhhhh, Monsieur LeFromage.  Tell me everything."

He recounted the tale of his prized cheese, a masterpiece he had been aging for months, stolen from his cellar the night before.  The thief had left no trace, only a faint scent of lavender and a tiny paw print on the cheese board.  "It's the work of Marcel 'The Mouse' Dupree, I tell you!"  He declared, his voice trembling. 

Hen, with her sharp mind, knew a cheese thief when she saw one.  She immediately started piecing together the puzzle.  The lavender scent?  A telltale sign of Marcel’s notorious penchant for perfumed cheese wrappers. The tiny paw print?  A clever ruse to distract the authorities. 

"Don't you worry, Monsieur LeFromage," Hen assured him.  "I'll get your cheese back." 

And so, Hen embarked on a daring cheese chase.  Following the trail of lavender and crumbs, she tracked Marcel to a lavish party in the town square.  There, amidst a sea of revelers, she spotted him, stuffing a wedge of Camembert into his pocket. 

Hen, with the grace of a seasoned cheese-monger, swiftly swiped the cheese from Marcel’s grasp and confronted him.  "Marcel Dupree," she said, her voice firm but polite.  "Return the stolen cheese to its rightful owner, or face the consequences."

Marcel, caught red-handed, meekly surrendered the cheese. "Omgggg, Hen!" he squeaked.  "You caught me!  But how?  It was the perfect crime!"

"My dear Marcel," Hen replied, "the cheese speaks for itself.  But next time, I suggest you try a Gouda, it's much easier to hide!" 

Hen returned the stolen cheese to Monsieur LeFromage, who was overjoyed.  "My dear Henrietta, you are a true hero!  You saved my reputation!"

**Moral of the Story:**

Even the most cunning of thieves cannot outsmart a good cheese monger!  And as for stolen Camembert, well, it’s a crime against humanity!
