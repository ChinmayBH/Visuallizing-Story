Story Generation and Visualization Platform
Welcome to the Story Generation and Visualization Platform, a collaborative project designed to dynamically create stories based on user-input keywords. This platform leverages state-of-the-art generative models for storytelling and image generation to bring your stories to life with stunning visuals.

Overview
This repository aims to combine AI-driven storytelling with AI-generated visual content. Users provide keywords or prompts, and the system generates a cohesive, engaging story. Afterward, the generated story is converted into visual representations, offering a full narrative experience that bridges text and imagery.

Key Features
Interactive Story Creation: Users input keywords or themes, and the AI generates a detailed story with characters, plot, and moral elements.
Visual Storytelling: Once a story is generated, the platform uses an image generation model to visualize key scenes from the narrative.
Collaborative and Customizable: Built for collaboration, allowing contributors to experiment with different models and fine-tune the storytelling and visualization processes.
Workflow
User Input: Users provide a prompt, keyword, or theme.
Story Generation: The AI model generates a narrative based on the input. The story follows structured storytelling techniques like the ABDCE method (Action, Background, Development, Climax, Ending).
Visualization: The platform then calls an AI-powered image generation model to create visual representations of key story scenes.
Output: Users receive a complete package with both text and images, making the storytelling experience immersive and engaging.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7+
pip
Install the necessary dependencies by running:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/story-visualization-platform.git
cd story-visualization-platform
Install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up your API keys for the generative models (story and image). Example:

Generative AI (Story): Set your API key for the storytelling model in config.py.
Generative AI (Image): Add your image generation model API key in config.py as well.
Run the app:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
Usage
Enter a keyword or theme in the text input.
Click the "Generate Story" button to receive a fully generated story.
Visual representations of the story scenes will be displayed automatically once the story is generated.
Example
Input:

Keywords: "adventure", "friendship", "dragon"

Generated Story:

"In a land far away, two best friends, a brave knight named Roland and a curious wizard named Lyra, set out on an adventure to find a hidden treasure guarded by a wise dragon..."
